# 100-Days-Of-Code-
The log of my 100 Days Of Code 
01/21/2021

Today's Progress: I completed 23/28 Basic HTML and HTML5.

Thoughts: I was so lost when I signed up for the 100 days of code but eventually figured my way through github and Free code camp. I was overwhelmed , but I am starting to get the hang of it and I am excited to learn more. I learned a lot today.
