Today's Progress: I completed 23/28 Basic HTML and HTML5.

Thoughts: I was so lost when I signed up for the 100 days of code but eventually figured my way through github and Free code camp. I was overwhelmed , but I am starting to get the hang of it and I am excited to learn more. I learned a lot today.

Today's Progress: I completed Basic HTML and HTML5 and started on Basic CSS.

Thoughts: This section was more challenging and I was stuck on sizing an image. It took me a good 15 mins to figure it out. I used the help and people had good input. I was proud of myself for figuring it out and not giving up. Still feeling like I learned alot and excited.

Today's Progress: I got to the half point of Basic CSS.

Thoughts: This section continues to be challenging and I was stuck on sizing of boarders. It took me some time, but I figured it out. So far I am liking coding a lot. When I get stuck , I try different ways and then if nothing works, then I look for resources. I am learning a lot and I am proud of myself for getting this far.
